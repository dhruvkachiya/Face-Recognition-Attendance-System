# Face-Recognition-Attendance-System
Face Recognition Attendance System is a smart solution that uses computer vision to detect and recognize faces in real time. It marks attendance automatically with a timestamp, stores it in a database or file, and reduces manual work. It is secure, contactless, and prevents proxy attendance in institutions and offices.
